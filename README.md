# 🐢 Simple Robot Teleoperation Demo

This is a simple Python program that uses the **turtle** graphics module to simulate a robot you can control with your keyboard.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 index.py


Use the arrow keys to move the turtle:

⬆️ Up → Move forward

⬇️ Down → Move backward

⬅️ Left → Turn left

➡️ Right → Turn right

🧩 Description

The program creates a turtle-shaped robot that responds to your keyboard inputs.
It’s a fun way to understand basic control and motion in Python’s turtle module.
